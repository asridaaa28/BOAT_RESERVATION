# BOAT_RESERVATION

This is a Boat Reservation application. There are several Boats offering Boat ride as a service.

An user, can register himself as a User and he can reserve the seats in the Boats (each Boat has name and number of Seats). Each user can book as many seats and as many rides subject to Availability of Boars and Seats in the boat.

user can also cancell the reservation Admin can log in and create users, Boats, and view reservations.

The application is not launching as there are some issues and there is no proper support available.

I have ensured the following

    Unwanted dependencies are removed
